<div class="animal-description">
<p>Mr. Fluffles is a cat and a half. Don't let his profile photo fool you, he's as sweet as pie. Last week, just after mauling a full sized racoon, Mr. Fluffles climbed up onto the shelter's kitchen counter and ripped into a 50lb bag of flour, just to get a taste. Mr. Fluffles! You're so naughty, but we love you.</p>

<p>Duke was found a few weeks back left abandoned in a box in the WaWa parking lot.  A shame, as Duke is a sweet dog who is good with kids, that is looking for a great home.</p>

<div class="animal-description">
<p>In Port Richmond, we don't beat around the bush, and neither does Ol' Boozy, a former sailing bird found abandoned on pier 18 (Graffiti Pier). His mates must have had a swift exit and forgotten about Ol' Boozy. He's a bird that knows a thing or two about ocean currents and the best rum pairings for hard tack and grease grits. Take him home today, and begin a sea farin' life tomorrow with your competent first mate. Yargh.</p>
